#Problem 1:
#How would you compare the followings: (YES, yes), and (NO, no)? Hint: what methods would you use?
#Then use one of these methods to compare them with a user input and display the result (true or false)
#Then use a logical operator to combine both terms in one boolean expression to compare and display the result.

# yesUpper = "YES"
# yesLower = "yes"
# noUpper = "NO"
# noLower = "no"

# print("Does YES equal yes?:", yesUpper == yesLower)
# print("Does NO equal no?:", noUpper == noLower)

# yes1 = input("Please enter YES: ")
# yes2 = input("Please enter yes: ")
# no1 = input("Please enter NO: ")
# no2 = input("Please enter no: ")

# print(yes1 == yesUpper and yes2 == yesLower and no1 == noUpper and no2 == noLower) #compares the useripnut with the variables set at the start of the code

# Problem 2:
# Suppose that we have three variables (day, ticketPrice and status) â€“ the day can be either weekday or weekend; the status can be one of the following: a student, a child less than 14 years old, or an elder greater than 65 years old.
# Use logical operators to test the three variable all in one line by joining them in a compound conditional expression. Then display the result (True or False)
